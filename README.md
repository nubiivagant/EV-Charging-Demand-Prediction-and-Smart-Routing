# ⚡ EV Demand Prediction, Charging Infrastructure Clustering & Intelligent Routing System

A complete end-to-end system that predicts EV charging demand using machine learning, clusters high-demand regions using K-Means, and provides API-based routing to the nearest charging station. The project is implemented using **Python**, **Streamlit**, **Scikit-Learn**, **Folium**, and **Routing APIs** such as OSRM / OpenRouteService / Google Maps.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project integrates two core components into one intelligent EV ecosystem: 

### 1️⃣ **EV Charging Infrastructure Clustering (K-Means)**
K-Means is used to cluster the city into hotspot regions where charging stations should be prioritized.

### 2️⃣ **Real-Time EV Routing System**
Uses an external API to compute:
- Best route to a charging station  
- Distance  
- Travel time  
- Navigation path plotted on the map  

This integrates infrastructure planning + operational routing.
